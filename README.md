# Yelp Camp

This website was fully developed by myself, using the Web Development Bootcamp 2021 course with Colt Steele as the instructor, I followed through all his instructions building the site, fixed some bugs as well that was not mentioned, and learned a lot along the way with this 63 hour long course, this site is based on building different campgrounds by making an account, updating and deleting your camps as well, and give feedback in form of a review on other camps, this site is comprised of: HTML, CSS, JS, BootStrap, EJS templating, MongoDB as the database, and Node.js packages such as Express, Passport for authentication, Cloudinary for images, Mapbox to display geo-locations of said camps, then I seeded the website with random places and camps to make it look more populated and better in my opinion. Lastly, by using GitBash, we uploaded the site to the Heroku server and deployed it.

I have learned a lot about this course, even more than what I learned at the university, I am planning on making a full website but this time with my theme in place and how I want it to look and be sooner or later.
